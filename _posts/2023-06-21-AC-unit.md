As a final project for my CSE 474 class "Introduction to Embeeded Systems", we were tasked to create a model solution to a problem
using task schedulers in arduino. Using a preemptive scheduler provided by FREERTOS, which can be quickly incorporated with arduino,
my lab partner and I were able to create what could be considered a air conditioner, or automated fan.

A user is able to turn a potentiometer, changing a value on the 7-segment LED displays. This value is then used to decide when the fan
should turn on. If the temperature read by the sensor is higher than the one set by the user, the arduino is signalled to activate 
the fan.

This project uses a majority of the available memory that can be used by arduino and resembles the limits that I can currently push 
arduino. I hope to make more projects in the future!

The code for this project can be found in my github at the following link: [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula)
