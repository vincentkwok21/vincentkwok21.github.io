To compile all my projects I have made so far for this website (and more), I have created a 3 minute video. This video took quite a bit of
time to edit. A lot of the footage used in this video was rerecorded by recreating the original projects causing even more delays. For this
3 minute video, at least 12 hours were spent on its production. Enjoy!
