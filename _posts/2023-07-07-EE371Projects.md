I have decided to do a recap of my projects in the clas of EE 371, it is the second class in the SystemVerilog series for electrical and computer engineers at the University of Washington. A 
brief class description is shown [here](https://www.ece.uw.edu/abet/?id=4320). This class focuses on using ASMD charts, timing diagrams/concepts, pipelining, and creating block diagrams that
can be modelled in code by using modules that correspond to certain structures in hardware. The labs of this course require the full programming of RAM and mathematical operator modules as well as a full
documentation of each lab as well. I have included the [GIT repo](https://github.com/vincentkwok21/EE-371-Labs) for the labs, code and reports of the class as a post explaining how each lab is programmed would be far too long.
