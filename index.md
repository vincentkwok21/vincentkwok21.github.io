Welcome to my website! My name is Vincent, and I'm thrilled to share my journey with you. I am a senior studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington, where I've been delving into the fascinating world of circuits, electronics, and technology. However, my passion extends far beyond the classroom.

One of my greatest joys is working on personal projects, and that's precisely what led me to create this website. It's a platform where I can showcase my skills, share my knowledge, and connect with fellow enthusiasts like you. Through this site, I aim to provide valuable insights, creative solutions, and inspiration for those interested in the field of electrical engineering.


When I'm not engrossed in the world of engineering, you'll often find me engaging in various activities that fuel my sense of adventure. I'm an avid swimmer, finding solace in the water as it allows me to disconnect from the world and focus on self-improvement. Badminton, calistenics and climbing also captivate my attention, offering physical challenges that push me to new heightsâ€”both literally and metaphorically. I am a very adventurous person, always looking to do something new and exciting!

Gaming is another passion of mine. It serves as an outlet for creativity, strategy, and relaxation. Whether it's exploring immersive virtual worlds or competing with friends, gaming provides a unique blend of entertainment and mental stimulation.

Beyond the realm of technology and physical activities, I find immense fascination in the natural world. Insects and flowers, with their vibrant colors, intricate structures, and remarkable adaptations, have captured my attention since I was young. Their beauty and diversity inspire me and remind me of the intricate designs that exist in both nature and engineering. You can find some images I have taken of my adventures and such in the gallery tab!
