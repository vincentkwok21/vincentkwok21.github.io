Welcome to my website! I'm Vincent, and I'm excited to have you here. Currently, I'm a senior studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington. My academic journey has immersed me in the intricate realms of circuits, electronics, and technology, but my passion extends well beyond the classroom.

I've always found immense satisfaction in embarking on personal projects, and that's what inspired the creation of this website. It serves as a platform for me to exhibit my skills, share insights, and connect with fellow enthusiasts like yourself. My goal is to offer valuable insights, innovative solutions, and a source of inspiration for those intrigued by the realm of electrical engineering.

Beyond the world of engineering, I find joy in a variety of activities that fuel my sense of adventure. I also enjoy activities like badminton, calisthenics, and climbing, which provide both physical challenges and opportunities for growth. Always on the lookout for new experiences, I thrive on adventure and exploration.

Gaming is another passion of mine. You will see various projects related to computer input applications such as the airmouse and game controller.

Beyond the realm of technology and physical activities, I find immense fascination in the natural world. Insects and flowers, with their vibrant colors, intricate structures, and remarkable adaptations, have captured my attention since I was young. Their beauty and diversity inspire me and remind me of the intricate designs that exist in both nature and engineering. You can find some images I have taken of my adventures and such in the gallery tab!
